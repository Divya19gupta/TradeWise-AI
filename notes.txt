1) LangChain
Think of LangChain like a recipe or workflow for AI.
It decides the steps: what happens first, what happens next.

Example in your Zerodha clone:
Fetch latest news about a stock → Step 1
Give the news to the AI model → Step 2
AI summarizes → return to your app → Step 3

So, LangChain is just organizing the flow of how AI should do its job.

2) RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is used when the AI doesn’t already know something (or it’s not part of its training).
Now imagine the AI model is super smart but forgetful. It doesn’t know today’s stock news unless you tell it.
-- Retrieval → you fetch the data (e.g., news articles).
-- Augment → you feed this data to the AI along with the question.
-- Generation → AI uses that data to give a proper answer.

You fetch that information from an external source (news, docs, PDFs, database, etc.).
You feed it along with your prompt/task to the AI.
The AI then uses that new info to give an answer.

Example:
- User clicks “Infosys”
- You fetch 3 news articles about Infosys
- Feed them to the AI → it outputs:
“Infosys rose today due to strong US demand and a new AI partnership.”
So RAG is how you make the AI “remember” or know external info it normally wouldn’t.

Think of it like:
AI = chef
RAG = fresh ingredients
Prompt = recipe
LangChain = full workflow of making the dish

So LangChain organizes the process, and RAG provides info the AI didn’t know.
